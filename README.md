COMPSCI316
==========

Note from Vivian on version 1.0 on 26th. 
=====
I changed the name of the entire project from microblog to final project

and now flask/bin/python doesn't work

i think the virtualenv might have died or been routed incorrectly because my computer still looks in microblog instead of what i've renamed the project to. you guys will probably have to trouble shoot or create an entirely new project u_u

i will be fixing this problem myself tomorrow. and i'll update
